<h2>FAQs for Volunteers</h2>
<p>
The Peace Corps is committed to providing a compassionate, effective, and coordinated response to all Volunteers who are affected by crime. The Office of Victim Advocacy (OVA) is a resource to Volunteers/Trainees (V/Ts) who have been victims of sexual assault, stalking, and other crimes, including those who have witnessed a crime.</p>

<h2>When should a V/T contact the Victim Advocate?</h2>

<p>The Victim Advocate is available to answer questions and provide assistance for matters related to a crime. The Victim Advocate gives priority to cases of sexual assault, stalking, and other serious crimes.</p>

<h2>Will the Victim Advocate contact a V/T without a V/T request?</h2>

<p>
Yes. When a V/T reports a sexual assault, stalking, or other serious crime (i.e.: incidents that involve physical violence and/or a weapon) the Victim Advocate will reach out to the V/T by phone and/or email to ensure they are aware of the available support services and options.</p>

<h2>Can a V/T choose which services the Victim Advocate will provide?</h2>

<p>V/Ts are not required to use any of the services available from the Office of Victim Advocacy. It is entirely up to the V/T to decide which of those services the V/T will use.</p>

<h2>Is the information a V/T shares with the Victim Advocate confidential?</h2>

<p>The Victim Advocate only shares information that is necessary to facilitate access to the services requested by a V/T. The Victim Advocate will inform the V/T of who is being told, what they are being told, and why so that the V/T may make an informed decision regarding the information being shared. [Except in an emergency, the Victim Advocate will ask for the V/T’s consent before sharing information with anyone else.]</p>

<h2>Can a V/T make an anonymous report to the Victim Advocate?</h2>

<p>A V/T can make an anonymous report to the Victim Advocate but this will limit the services that the Victim Advocate will be able to provide.</p>
